# ARCap Unity Tool for exUMI

This is the Meta Quest Unity app for exUMI, which is slightly modified from [ARCap](https://github.com/Ericcsr/ARCap). We clean the project and only keep the 6D pose mocap function. Thanks for their great work!

## Usage

1. For users: Install the `exUMI_ARCap_release.apk` on your Quest with [MQDH](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/ts-mqdh/). Remember to enable developer mode on your Quest.
2. For Developers: Build your own application by opening this project with Unity.
